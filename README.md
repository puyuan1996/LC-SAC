Implementation of LC-SAC method in PyTorch.
 
Noteï¼šThe code in this repository is different from the code that produced the experimental results of the 
original IJCNN 2020 paper (Yuan Pu, Shaochen Wang, Xin Yao, Bin Li. Latent Context Based Soft Actor-
Critic. 2020 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks.).
We have made many improvements in the algorithm. For the specific difference, please see the research report in arxiv:
Yuan Pu, Shaochen Wang, Xin Yao, Bin Li. Context-Based Soft Actor Critic for
Environments with Non-stationary Dynamics. https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03310.

For producing the experiment results in MetaWorld environment, you should install the metaworld package.
